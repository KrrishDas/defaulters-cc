# Defaulters on Credit Cards â€“ Internship Project

This repository contains my **Summer 2025 data science internship project** with Stratlytics.  
The project explores macroeconomic and financial factors contributing to **credit card default risk**, using machine learning (Logistic Regression with regularization).

The full project (code, detailed README, and reports) is inside the [`defaulters-cc`](./defaulters-cc) folder.

## Highlights
- Consolidated 28+ macroeconomic & financial datasets into a unified dataset.
- Preprocessed with imputation, scaling, and feature engineering.
- Built logistic regression models in Python (`scikit-learn`), achieving **94%+ accuracy** and **ROC-AUC â‰ˆ 0.97â€“1.00**.
- Evaluated with **confusion matrices, ROC/PR curves, and loss curves**.
- Compared **L1, L2, and Elastic Net regularization** to understand feature importance.
- Visualized insights with `matplotlib` and structured the project with a reproducible pipeline.
